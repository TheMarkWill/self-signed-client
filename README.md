# Client Certificate Authentication (mTLS) with Node.js

This is demo on how to do client authentication with certificates, **mTLS or mutual TLS** - as opposed to username and passwords with out of the box (OOTB) Node.js.

This demo has a server with two clients:

- "super_mark" who has a server-signed trusted certificate
- "Alice" who has an invalid self-signed certificate

<!-- # Demo: How to Use

First install required dependencies with `npm install`. Then the demo works as follows:

## Step 1 - Start Server

We start a sever that by default only accepts requests authenticated by client certificates

```
npm run server
```

You can test this is working by opening [https://localhost:4433/](https://localhost:4433/) in your browser. 

## Step 2 - Test Valid Client (Alice)

**Alice** has a valid certificate issued by server, so she can talk to the server:

```
$ npm run valid-client

> node ./client/valid-app.js

Hello Alice, your certificate was issued by localhost!
```

## Step 3 - Test Invalid Client (Bob)

**Bob** has a self-issued certificate, which is rejected by the server:

```
$ npm run invalid-client

> node ./client/invalid-app.js

Sorry Bob, certificates from Bob are not welcome here.
```

## Server Certificates

- CN: localhost
- O: Client Certificate Demo

```bash
openssl req \
	-x509 \
	-newkey rsa:4096 \
	-keyout server/server.key \
	-out server/server.cert \
	-nodes \
	-days 365 \
	-subj "/CN=api.hoopay.com.br/C=BR/ST=MT/L=Primavera do Leste/O=HooPay ME/OU=IT"
```

This command shortens following _three_ commands:

- `openssl genrsa` 
- `openssl req`
- `openssl x509`

which generates _two_ files:

- `server_cert.pem`
- `server_key.pem`

## Create Client Certificates

For demo, two users are created:

- Alice, who has a valid certificate, signed by the server
- Bob, who creates own certificate, self-signed


### Create Alice's Certificate (server-signed and valid)

We create a certificate for Alice.

- sign alice's Certificate Signing Request (CSR)...
- with our server key via `-CA server/server_cert.pem` and
	`-CAkey server/server_key.pem` flags
- and save results as certificate

```bash
# generate server-signed (valid) certifcate
openssl req \
	-newkey rsa:4096 \
	-keyout client/mark.key \
	-out client/mark.csr \
	-nodes \
	-days 5000 \
	-subj "/CN=MARCON WILLIAN OLIVEIRA NEVES HOOPAY/C=BR/ST=MT/L=Primavera do Leste/OU=baf1fb2d-d85d-4cf7-96bf-c913e8263871"

# sign with server_cert.pem
openssl x509 \
	-req \
	-in client/mark.csr \
	-CA server/server.cert \
	-CAkey server/server.key \
	-out client/mark.cert \
	-set_serial 01 \
	-days 365
```

### Create Bob's Certificate (self-signed and invalid)

Bob creates own without our server key.

```bash
# generate self-signed (invalid) certifcate
openssl req \
	-newkey rsa:4096 \
	-keyout client/bob_key.pem \
	-out client/bob_csr.pem \
	-nodes \
	-days 365 \
	-subj "/CN=Bob"

# sign with bob_csr.pem
openssl x509 \
	-req \
	-in client/bob_csr.pem \
	-signkey client/bob_key.pem \
	-out client/bob_cert.pem \
	-days 365
```

## Notes

- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a "free, automated, and open" Certificate Authority
- **PEM**: Privacy Enhanced Mail is a Base64 encoded DER certificate
